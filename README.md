# Swift Reduce Function Gotcha: Accumulator Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce` function in Swift.  The error arises from incorrectly handling the accumulator within the closure passed to the `reduce` function.  Specifically, the example shows the importance of carefully considering the accumulator (running total) when the reduction operation involves more than a simple addition or concatenation.  The solution demonstrates how to explicitly handle the accumulator for clarity and correctness.

## Problem

The `reduce` function is a powerful tool, but it can be prone to errors if the logic within the closure is not meticulously defined, especially when dealing with complex operations beyond simple addition or concatenation. Failure to properly handle the accumulator can lead to incorrect results or runtime crashes.

## Solution

To solve this, explicit handling of the accumulator within the reduce closure is crucial.  The solution clearly defines the accumulator and the current element in the closure. This makes the code more readable and less prone to errors.
